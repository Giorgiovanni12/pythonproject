when can you repeat that I'm always so surprised when my partner said that to
me in my own mind and to my own ears what I said came out
clearly but obviously it didn't come out that way because he wasn't able to say
it's happening to me lazy mouth I'm going to show you and exercise that professional
broadcasters do to keep them out in tiptop shape is really fun and silly and
you can do an almost anywhere at any time so make sure to watch the
end of this video that you can practise it as well last week I am
seed a gala for non-profit it was called untapped and it's all about funny employment
for people from diverse groups aboriginal people disabilities new immigrants I was also interviewing the
CEO of vancity to my room in on stage so I wanted to do a
great job job now I use the MC events all the time but I got
a practise and I was realising that so was my mouth I was getting lazy
with my mouth this is why this is bad news Brown the whole point of
communicating is to be understood and when you really boiling down to the basic it
comes down to your mouth and instruments to keep our mouth fine-tuned like an instrument
and we want to make sure that it keeps in great shape so how do
we go back doing that Three Steps one grab a pen to put in your
mouth 3 say the alphabet come on with me but we don't want them to
be asking what what is it that you said again so try this exercise and
tell me how it goes this is so important because we want to make sure
to keep our Mel's in tiptop shape by making a mouth and work harder and
enunciating are words especially if you're going to be on stage giving a speech or
before you record a video go to jelly beck.com / blog the exercise and tell
me what you learn j a y n y d a ik.com and remember don't
get left behind you can shine online keep your a mouth in tip top shape
because with a lazy mouth you risk being misunderstood or even worse not being heard
at all
